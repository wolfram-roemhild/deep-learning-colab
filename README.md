# Tutorials and Laboratory of Applied Deep Learning - based on Colab notebooks

## Get started with Deep Learning

To accelerate my own learning journey, I've started to compile a structured repository of Deep Learning Tutorials. 
* Where needed, I've adapted the examples to work in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) where [Junyper Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) can be directly executed
* Most examples are [forked](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) from the original repositories

Key sources for the repository are
* The TensorFlow documentation for [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org)
* The MIT course [6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/2018/index.html)
* The [Udacity Deep Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730) courses
* The Book [Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-reinforcement-learning-hands) by Maxim Lapan

## Basic Classification with MNIST handwritten numbers dataset
* Very compact [Tensorflow example](TensorFlow_MNIST.ipynb), or with [different](TensorFlow_MNIST_adapted_parameters.ipynb) network parameters
*
